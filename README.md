# SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Singapore is a popular tourist destination, receiving a large number of visitors from across the world annually. Apart from famous attractions such as the Universal Studios, Marina Bay Sands, it is also home to a large, diverse and unique mix of food cuisines, which is what Singapore is also known for. Tourists in Singapore have a wide range of food options to choose from. However, tourists often have a difficult time choosing a place to have their meals as there are too many choices available and not enough information to guide them in this decision.

Hence, a solution that provides tourists with such information and recommendations may be beneficial to them, enhancing their experience here in Singapore. In this project, we develop an online chatbot using Google Dialogflow and Python that allows tourists to use during their stay in Singapore. The chatbot provides recommendations of food outlets based on touristsâ€™ cuisine or location queries.
